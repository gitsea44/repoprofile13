The project is a algoritmic trading system that uses reinforcement learning to try and teach a neural network how to trade.\n\nCurrently the model is profitable under certian conditions. Specifically trading fees must be set to zero or else it simply loses money. That being the case I don't think the current system is deployable in a real market, but maybe with some more work it can be.\n", 'contents': "['.idea', 'LICENSE', 'Plots.ipynb', 'Procfile', 'README.md', 'app.py', 'model', 'requirements.txt', 'runtime.txt', 'static', 'templates']", 'stars': 0, 'watchers': 0, 'forks': 0, 'deprepos': 0, 'deppacks': 0}
