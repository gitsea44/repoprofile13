Requires Python 3.6.\n\n## Approach\n\nTry to keep all rewards on the same scale, since visualizations of models will be better.  \n\nTried to incorporate the velocity of the car in the reward function, but this caused the agent to just swing back and forth.  \nAt the top of the hill, the car slows down, so it would turn back around before reaching the goal.\n\nInspired by: https://keon.io/deep-q-learning/\n', 'contents': "['.gitignore', 'Pipfile', 'README.md', 'src']", 'stars': 0, 'watchers': 0, 'forks': 0, 'deprepos': 0, 'deppacks': 0}
