FeedRobot serves personalized news feeds.\nConfigure a number of feeds and start reading, the trusty robot will automatically\nlearn from your reading habits and offer assistance by recommending interesting items.\n\n## How does FeedRobot work?\nThe application uses a reinforcement learning agent to learn how to recommend content items\nbased on items that you've read before. It will learn your personal preferences and move\nwith you as your interests change over time.\n\nI got the idea from the paper [Deep Reinforcement Learning based Recommendation with Explicit User-Item Interactions Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12027.pdf). This paper is describes how to use actor-critic methods to train an agent to recommend items from newsfeeds.\n\nThe paper sadly doesn't go into much detail on how to make this actually scale beyond a lab environment.\nI'm hoping that by implementing this sample I will learn how to take the idea in the paper and convert it into a real solution.\n\nThe application itself is implemented as a django application. For the well-informed, I originally implemented\nthe code as a set of microservices but abandoned that as it brought along way too much complexity.\n\n## Getting started\nFollow the instructions on the [wiki](https://github.com/wmeints/feedrobot/wiki/Build-and-installation-guide) to get started.\n\n## Contributing\nFind this project interesting and want to contribute?
