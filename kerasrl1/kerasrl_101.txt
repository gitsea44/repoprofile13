Perhaps the two programs are unnecessarily coupled\n- Redo the pegging AI using a more programmatic, heuristic approach instead of a machine learning one\n', 'contents': "['README.md', 'card.py', 'game.py', 'pegging_ai.py', 'poster2.pdf', 'requirements.txt', 'rl.py', 'throwing_ai.py', 'util.py']", 'stars': 0, 'watchers': 0, 'forks': 0, 'deprepos': 0, 'deppacks': 0}
