In the past, notable work has been done in this domain with researchers either looking at reinforcement learning or generative adversarial networks as their weapons of choice to modify the states of a malware executable in order to deceive anti-virus agents. Our solution makes use of a combination of deep reinforcement learning and GANs in order to overcome some of the limitations faced while using these approaches independently.\n\nFind our full documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WDYrzpCX6Mwkij3FSb7KGS-PKGtPhpxKtT-ywGrvi6w/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n\n## Table of Content\n\n\n+ [Overview](#overview)\n+ [Installation Instructions](#installation-instructions)\n+ [Training and Testing Data](#training-and-testing-data)\n+ [Running Instructions](#running-instructions) \n+ [Testing Procedures and results](#testing-procedures-and-results)\n+ [Known Issues and Fixes](#known-issues-and-fixes)\n+ [Future Additions](#to-do)\n+ [Built With](#built-with)\n+ [Authors](#authors)\n+ [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)\n+ [References](#references)\n\n\n\n## Overview\n\n\nThe proposed solution successfully generates a mutated malware sample by using reinforcement learning to decide on the sequence of modifications to make. In case the modifications chosen by the RL agent is either adding import functions or adding/renaming section names, GANs are used to generate an adversarial feature vector of imports and sections that perturb a malware to appear benign in contrast to randomly selecting the imports and sections. \n\n<p align="center">\n <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ew95L8R.png" align="middle">\n</p>\n\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\n> :warning: This has been tested on Linux devices only.

[click here](#testing-instructions)\n\n> Note: If you wish to skip the training and jump directly to testing our trained model [click here](#testing-instructions)\n\n1. Feature extraction and feature mapping vector generation.\n\n   + The first step in the training process is generating a feature vector mapping for section names and import functions from a    malware and benign binary samples.  \n\n      ```sh\n      python extract_features.py\n      \n      python extract_features.py --help\n      ```\n      > For more debugging information, view the log files generated in `Logs\\extract_features_logs.log`.\n    \n   + The `extract_features.py` python script outputs the following files in the output directory:\n      + **Features Vector Mapping** - _feature_vector_mapping.pk_, _import_feature_vector_mapping.pk_ and _section_feature_vector_mapping.pk_\n      + **Malware Feature Vectors** - _malware-feature-set.pk_, _malware-pe-files-import-feature-set.pk_ and _malware-pe-files-section-feature-set.pk_\n      + **Benign Feature Vectors** - _benign-feature-set.pk_, _benign-pe-files-import-feature-set.pk_ and _benign-pe-files-section-feature-set.pk_\n\n1. Malware feature vector mutation using Generative Adversarial Networks. \n\n   + Once the feature mapping vector and the feature vectors for both the malware and benign binary samples have been generated, we can feed these feature vectors to a MalGAN model to generate adversarial feature vectors which appear to be benign. \n   \n      ```sh\n      python main_malgan.py\n      \n      python main_malgan.py --help \n      ```\n      > For more information, [see below](#acknowledgments).\n      \n      > For more debugging information, view the log files generated in `Logs\\"malGAN.log`.\n   \n   + You can train the MalGAN on either section features, import features or both by using the `--feature-type` flag. \n      > For example, to train the MalGAN for just sections using `--feature-type section`.\n     \n   + The `main_malgan.py` python script outputs the `adversarial_feature_array_set.pk` in the `adversarial_feature_vector_directory` directory.\n   \n   \n1. Binary Imports and Section Reconstruction.\n\n   + Once we have the adversarial feature vector from the MalGAN, we can feed it the `binary_builder.py` python script which uses the original feature mapping vector from step 1 to map the adversarial features back to the import functions and section names. \n   \n      ```sh\n      python binary_builder.py\n      \n      python binary_builder.py --help\n      ```\n      > For more debugging information, view the log files generated in `Logs\\"binary_builder_logs.log`.\n   \n   + Make sure to use the right feature vector mapping for the type of adversarial feature vector you have generated by using the `--feature-vector` optional argument. By default it will use the `feature_vector_mapping.pk` mapping. \n   \n      > For example: If you have generated a adversarial feature vector of only the sections, make sure to add the command `--feature-vector section` to correctly reconstruct the section name.\n   \n   + The `binary_builder.py` python script outputs the `adversarial_imports_set.pk` or the `adversarial_section_set.pk`, based on the feature mapping you select, in the `adversarial_feature_vector_directory` directory. \n   \n1. > There is one last step here. Soon to be completed. \n   \n\n### Testing Instructions\n\nThe output from GAN has already been stored as (`gym_malware/envs/controls/adverarial_imports_set.pk` and `gym_malware/envs/controls/adverarial_sections_set.pk`) and is being used for the training. \n\nThe training tests the learning agent after every 550 episodes with 200 samples. If the agent is able to generate 100 (50%) of mutated samples, the training stops and saves the model as dqeaf.pt which is used by the testing script.\n\n\n#### Execution\n\n1. Create a new directory `testing-samples` and copy your test samples into it. \n\n\n1. Run the `dqeaf-test.py` python script to mutate malware samples you loaded in `testing-samples` earlier. \n\n   ```\n   python dqeaf-test.py testing-samples\n   ```\n\n1. The mutated malware samples will be stored in the `evaded-samples` directory.\n\n\n\n## Testing Procedures and Results\n\n\n\n##### Results comparing the number of functional mutations generated when trained with different thresholds for detection and maximum mutations allowed (Testing Data : 250 samples)\n\n\n| Threshold for detection    | Maximum mutations allowed | Mutations Generated | Functional Mutation | Average VirusTotal Score |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n|             90%            |             80            |         140         |         114         |           40/69          |\n|             85%            |            120            |         115         |          62         |           29/69          |\n|             80%            |            160            |          94         |          24         |           11/69          |\n\n##### Results comparing the impact blackbox detector algorithm and activation function have on the TPR of the adversarially generated feature vector\n\n<p align="center">\n <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/N0DSZWbPwMUmNo0JRWmuVwSxDLHRUit7t2jcgUW4UfvYLOF365_fT0hvLuK_QWocZ4D9ugYXIxj11LKBAYOYqoj-lPGZzpyhBW8D0H8J" align="middle">\n</p>\n\n#### Results comparing the impact the size of the feature vector have on the TPR of the adversarially generated feature vector\n\n<p align="center">\n <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QtenUP6It_5W4Pysmr1TKZ1HlYdh9Q9cJ7F8gQ_rneb3lwkMnnwzMdtnXfY3r3dwJcFyb3_O4AwEDOflg4LVMkdeI6KdiGBWDytBjAPGuONk6q5mN7gTMVMeRj3i384NtuE1TpHe" align="middle">\n</p>\n\n\n## Known Issues and Fixes\n\n> :warning: WARNING: This segment is currently under construction.
