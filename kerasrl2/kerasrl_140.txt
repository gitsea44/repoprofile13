It is based on [Facebook's TorchCraft](https://github.com/TorchCraft/TorchCraft), which is a bridge between Torch and StarCraft for AI research.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) and its dependencies.\n\n2. Install [TorchCraft](https://github.com/TorchCraft/TorchCraft) and its dependencies. You can skip the torch client part. \n\n3. install /TorchCraft/py.\n    ```\n    cd /torchcraft/py\n    pip install -e .\n    ```\n\n4. Install the package itself:\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/Kyle1993/gym-starcraft-modified.git\n    cd gym-starcraft-modified\n    pip install -e .\n    ```\n\n## Usage\n1. Start StarCraft server with BWAPI by Chaoslauncher.\n\n2. Run examples:\n\n    ```\n    cd examples\n    python random_agent.py --ip $server_ip --port $server_port \n    ```\n    \n    The `$server_ip` and `$server_port` are the ip and port of the server running StarCraft.   \n    \n# Some Tips  \n1. It's no need to install torchcraft-py  \n\n2. Chose BWAPI v4.12, don't forget install BroodWar patch.   \n\n3. Replace the map folder `$StarCraft\\maps\\BroodWar\\micro` with the same name folder in my project  \n\n4. I have supplied some battle map in `\\micro` folder,you can chose them by change the bwapi config file: `$STARCRAFT/bwapi-data/bwapi.ini`. You can even create new battle maps , __But please make sure the env parameter`myself_num` and `enemy_num` is equal to the content of your map(number of the units you control and number of units computer control)__\n\n5. The env will return the basic observation data in each step, you should extract the state info you need in you own code.  \nthe observation data look like this`{'myself':[M_unit0, M_unit1, ... , M_unitm], 'enemy':[E_unit0, E_unit1, ... ,E_unitn]}`  \n\n6. Each unit have a 3-dim action, in alibaba code, it is represented like [move_or _attack, degree, distance], I offer a alternative representation [move_or_attack, position_x, position_y]\n", 'contents': "['.idea', 'README.md', 'bwapi.ini', 'examples', 'gym_starcraft', 'micro', 'setup.py']", 'stars': 4, 'watchers': 4, 'forks': 1, 'deprepos': 0, 'deppacks': 0}
