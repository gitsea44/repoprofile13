Due to license agreements, the raw data must be downloaded from Schneider Electric; this project assumes the raw data is then placed in the `data/` subdirectory.\n\n\n## Structure of this repo\n\nFile | Description |\n---- | ----- |\n`├── data` | A directory that has all of the input data as `.csv`s that are provided by the competition. Now that the [DrivenData competition](https://github.com/drivendataorg/power-laws-optimization) has completed, you can find the data on [Schneider Electric's website](https://data.exchange.se.com/explore/dataset/power-laws-optimizing-demand-side-strategies-training-data/information/?disjunctive.site_id). <br></br>There are minor differences in data format and naming conventions between the DrivenData competition and on Scheider Electric's website, which are handled by `./prepare_data.py` |\n`├── output` | A directory for storing the output of a single simulation run. |\n`├── all_results` | This directory contains results from all of the runs executed. |\n`├── simulate` | The Python code for the simulation. |\n`·   ├── assets` | **A FOLDER FOR ANY TRAINED MODELS/DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE LOADED BY `battery_controller.py`** |\n`·   ├── battery.py` | Contains an object for storing information about the battery. Some of the params of the Battery object include `(dis)charging capacity`, `(dis)charging efficiency`, and the `current charge` of the battery at the time of instantiation. |\n`·   ├── simulate.py` | Main entrypoint. Controls and executes the simulations. Tracks energy costs of electrifying the site with and without battery, which inform level of effectiveness of `propose_state_of_charge` method in `./battery_controller.py`. |\n`·   └──battery_controller.py` | Contains a `propose_state_of_charge` which suggests (dis)charging action based upon: <br></br>* Recent load / PV production at given timestep<br/>* Load / PV forecasts for future timesteps<br/>* Price of buying/selling energy at given timestep |\n`├── Dockerfile` | The definition for the Docker container on which the simulation executes. |\n`├── prepare_data.py` | File to account for differences between expected format of data from DrivenData and Schneider Electric |\n`├── README.md` | About the project. |\n`├── entrypoint.sh` | Called inside the container to execute the simulation. Can also be used locally. |\n`├── requirements.txt` | The Python libraries that will be installed. Only the libraries in this official repo will be available. |\n`└── run.sh` | The only command you need. Builds and runs simulations in the Docker container. |", 'contents': "['Dockerfile', 'Pipfile', 'Pipfile.lock', 'README.md', 'all_results', 'data', 'entrypoint.sh', 'notebooks', 'output', 'prepare_data.py', 'requirements.txt', 'research', 'run.sh', 'scripts', 'simulate', 'visualizations']", 'stars': 0, 'watchers': 0, 'forks': 0, 'deprepos': 0, 'deppacks': 0}
