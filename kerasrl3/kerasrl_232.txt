Some of the original modules were replaced or removed. In case you want to use this model to solve other problems, please, start with the [original repo](https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch).\n\n# Hardware\nKaggle's kernel environment with GPU support was used to develop and run this solution. Approximate specs are listed bellow:\n- Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.20GHz, 2 cores\n- 13 Gb RAM\n- 1 x NVIDIA Tesla P100\n\n# Software\n- Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)\n- Python 3.6.6\n- CUDA 10.0.130\n- cuddn 7.5.0\n- NVIDIA drivers 418.67\n\n# Configuration\nThe description of available settings can be found in the beginning of *utils.py*. Some of them (like parallel execution or half/mixed precision) won't work, because the required functionality was partially removed.\n\nTo change path to model inputs *--data_root* and *--label_root* parameters should be set to appropriate locations.\n\n# Training\nTo start training a new model execute *run_train.sh*. You may want to edit it first to change some of the settings.\n\n# Generating images\nExecute *run_sample.sh*. To set the number of images to be generated change *--sample_num* parameter. Generated images will be stored in the *--samples_root* directory (*./samples* by default). Zip archive with generated images will be saved in the script root directory.\n\n# Pretrained model weights\nYou can download it from [this Kaggle's dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dvorobiev/generative-dog-images-biggan-weigths) (Kaggle's account required). Typically the script expects weights to be in *./weights/generative_dog_images* directory, but you can change this behavior by setting *--weights_root* and *--experiment_name* parameters.\n\n# Misc\n```\n@inproceedings{\nbrock2018large,\ntitle={Large Scale {GAN} Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis},\nauthor={Andrew Brock and Jeff Donahue and Karen Simonyan},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1xsqj09Fm},\n}\n```\n", 'contents': "['.gitignore', 'BigGAN.py', 'LICENSE', 'README.md', 'dataset.py', 'layers.py', 'run_sample.sh', 'run_train.sh', 'sample.py', 'train.py', 'train_fns.py', 'utils.py']", 'stars': 6, 'watchers': 6, 'forks': 1, 'deprepos': 'zero', 'deppacks': 'zero'}
