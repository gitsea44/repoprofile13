Having a custom environment is really confusing, in terms of directory structure. So the `env.py` is supposed to be a shortcut to `gym-unicycle/gym_unicycle/envs/unicycle_env.py`. But sometimes shortcuts don't work well with git.\n\n## How to Use\n\n* Run `./makeEnv.sh`. This creates a virtual env. I can't have just a `requirements.txt` file, because the installation of gym and a custom env is a bit odd.\n", 'contents': "['.gitignore', 'README.md', 'env.py', 'gym-unicycle', 'main.py', 'makeEnv.sh', 'requirements.txt', 'testAgent.py', 'trained']", 'stars': 0, 'watchers': 0, 'forks': 0, 'deprepos': 0, 'deppacks': 0}
