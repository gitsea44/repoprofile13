After that it will tune itself to optimize the temperature\n\n\nTODO: Finalize the reward function. Right now it is a constant reward when the heater is off. More tuning needs to happen here.\n\n", 'contents': "['.gitignore', '.vscode', 'forward.txt', 'README.md', 'UsefulReferences.md', 'gym-hvac', 'gym_hvac_tester', 'hvac_learner', 'output', 'requirements.txt']", 'stars': 0, 'watchers': 0, 'forks': 0, 'deprepos': 0, 'deppacks': 0}
